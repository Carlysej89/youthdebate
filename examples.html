                 <p class="about">
                    With financial support from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), NDI developed a policy dialogue and debate program to support young people develop a range of political assets, increase the profile and credibility of their political voices, and connect them with public policymakers. At the start of the program NDI, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.urbandebatewashingtondc.org/">Washington Urban Debate League </a>, developed a dialogue and debate methodology incorporating NDI’s youth theory of change, in-house debate expertise, and lessons learned supporting youth debates globally, including the Ana Usharek program in Jordan and the Challenger program in Moldova.
                 </p>
                 <p>  
                    NDI developed the “Youth Leading Debate” (Jóvenes Liderando Debates) program in Guatemala as a pilot to help politically active young people, ages 18 to 24, learn the art of competitive policy debate and use their debate skills for policy reform. During the program, young people from urban and rural areas gathered in three cities: Coban, Quetzaltenango, and Guatemala City to participate in policy dialogues and debate instruction camps. These activities prepared them for a set of regional and national competitions where they confidently displayed their analytical skills and their ability to speak publicly in front of senior political leaders and other citizens.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Policy Dialogues</strong>
                    The debate program began with over 100 young people participating in three policy dialogues in Coban, Quetzaltenango, and Guatemala City. These events provided participants with an opportunity to identify issues that matter to them, learn from policy experts and discuss pressing policy issues facing their communities and their country. Elected officials also joined the dialogues to provide their expertise and political insights. For many participants, this was their first opportunity to have a discussion with an elected official who represented their community.
                 </p>
                 <p>  
                    <strong>Debate “Bootcamp”</strong>
                    Following the policy dialogues, participants were invited to apply for a three-day debate “bootcamp”, designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to policy debate. The debate bootcamps quickly accelerated their learning and provided a safe environment to explore a range of polarizing topics. There were twenty participants at each camp and the curriculum was facilitated by one debate expert and three to five experienced youth debaters. Participants developed interpersonal skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, active listening and communication. Participants also developed practical political skills, such as the ability to research issues and develop and defend comprehensive policy recommendations. This combination of political skills, coupled with “soft” skills, strengthened their ability to better understand Guatemala’s political climate, and take part in discussions around policy reform. Taking part in the camps helped the participants better understand perspectives on both sides of complex public policy issues, minimized polarization over controversial political topics, and helped participants build respect and understanding for each other, despite geographical, ethnic, and economic differences. These positive interactions increased constructive collaboration and paved the way for the productive exchange of ideas.

                 <p class="about"> 
                    <strong>Regional & National Competition</strong>
                    After the bootcamps, debate teams utilized the skills they learned to prepare for regional and national debate tournaments. During the preparation period, all teams were given a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10zZx4YA2tNd5S0W9QCRjxbYnG98F9MDa/view"> list of topics</a> to research. The topics stemmed from the policy dialogues and represented a wide range of local and national concerns. In addition to strengthening their debate skills, the tournaments provided the participants with an opportunity to continue developing peer-to-peer networks. These young people were able to connect with political actors and peers from different regions of the country who were also passionate about taking political action. For these young leaders, who are active members of civic organizations, political parties, and student organizations, participation in debates goes beyond competition. Public debate provides an important entry point for political participation and a vital platform for demonstrating the value of young people’s contribution to policy reform efforts among decision-makers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Media & Communications</strong>
                    Throughout the program NDI also worked with participants to develop a communication strategy and produce digital content, including social media posts and videos, that underscored young people’s knowledge, showcased their newly developed skills, and demonstrated the necessity for political processes and structures that are inclusive of young people. The communications strategy and the consistent, targeted messaging allowed participants to increase their political platform and reach.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Monitoring & Evaluation</strong>
                    Based on the pre- and post-tests, <strong>86 percent</strong> of participants stated that their knowledge of public sector reform increased and that the program activities increased their political leadership skills. Evaluations were also conducted that assessed the participant's interpersonal skill development: <strong>98 percent</strong> of participants reported that their self-confidence improved; <strong>99 percent</strong> of participants reported increased empathy and; <strong>96 percent</strong> of participants reported an increased perception of peer support. Participants were also given a baseline assessment to evaluate their skill development prior to the start of the debate bootcamp and a final evaluation after the national competition. Over the course of the program, the skills most improved were critical thinking and argumentation which is the process of reasoning systematically in support of an idea, action, or theory.
                 </p>
                 
                    Throughout the program the participants had sustained access to a network of <strong>44 young political activists and community leaders, 22 established or promising policy experts and political leaders</strong>, and representatives from <strong>17 community-based civic or political organizations</strong>. During each phase of the program, NDI developed social media materials, including five video productions, to develop the political profile of the participants and expand their reach locally and nationally. The video productions were also developed to illustrate the importance of debate and civil political dialogue for advocacy and policy reform. Each video production had over 1,000 unique views and reached 3,000-5,500 people respectively.

             <p><strong>Training and hands-on practice in grassroots political organizing and identifying issues, including going door-to-door</strong></p>

             <p>
                During the first phase of the program, NDI’s trainers lead participants through a series of grassroots political organizing exercises. Most new participants have an interest in Moldovan political life but have little or no experience. The first phase consists of several workshops and mentoring sessions led by NDI’s political trainers and Challenger alumni during which participants learn the basics to identify a community-based problem through grassroots outreach and practice analyzing the problem - using tools such as problem tree analysis - to elicit the root causes of the problem. Groups traditionally focus on issues that specifically affect youth in various parts of Moldova. This exercise includes practice unofficially surveying Moldovan youth in-person, or over the phone on the issues of top priority in their communities.
             </p>
             <p><strong>Training on policy analysis to address an issue, including a debating exercise</strong></p>
            <p>
                During the next phase of the program, the youth, in partnership with NDI’s political trainers, identify one overarching theme from their preliminary grassroots outreach as a central focus for the debating exercise during this phase of the program. Challenger alumni and NDI’s trainers provide group and individual mentorship sessions, teaching participants the basics of argumentation and counter argumentation, as well as, public speaking, professional writing and other skills relevant to policy development and debating. Youth are divided into small groups, which serve as debate teams. The entire cohort of participants watches a mock debate between Challenger alumni to learn the basic format and rules of the debate. At the end of this phase, participants hold a formal debate, judged by alumni of the program and NDI’s trainers. Some groups represent the government, while the others represent the “opposition” which is traditionally done using parliamentary-style debate. Groups receive feedback on how well they prepared arguments, as well as each individual group member’s preparedness, presentation and public speaking skills. The judges select the most successful debaters and these individuals continue on to the next phase of the program.
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>An extended case study on formulating policies to address a real-world problem</strong></p>
               <p>
                The debate program began with over 100 young people participating in three policy dialogues in Coban, Quetzaltenango, and Guatemala City. These events provided participants with an opportunity to identify issues that matter to them, learn from policy experts and discuss pressing policy issues facing their communities and their country. Elected officials also joined the dialogues to provide their expertise and political insights. For many participants, this was their first opportunity to have a discussion with an elected official who represented their community.
             </p>
             <p><strong>Value-based debating</strong></p>
                <p>
                Following the policy dialogues, participants were invited to apply for a three-day debate “bootcamp”, designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to policy debate. The debate bootcamps quickly accelerated their learning and provided a safe environment to explore a range of polarizing topics. There were twenty participants at each camp and the curriculum was facilitated by one debate expert and three to five experienced youth debaters. Participants developed interpersonal skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, active listening and communication. Participants also developed practical political skills, such as the ability to research issues and develop and defend comprehensive policy recommendations. This combination of political skills, coupled with “soft” skills, strengthened their ability to better understand Guatemala’s political climate, and take part in discussions around policy reform. Taking part in the camps helped the participants better understand perspectives on both sides of complex public policy issues, minimized polarization over controversial political topics, and helped participants build respect and understanding for each other, despite geographical, ethnic, and economic differences. These positive interactions increased constructive collaboration and paved the way for the productive exchange of ideas.
             </p>
             <p><strong>Manifesto development</strong></p>
                <p>
                At the end of the case study, Challenger groups produce a “manifesto” outlining the issues that they have identified through door-to-door (or virtual/phone) surveys of citizens, as well as proposed policy solutions from across the political spectrum. These solutions are based on research and analysis carried out over the course of several months, which received rigorous feedback from NDI’s trainers and Challenger alumni. Each iteration of the Challenger program (I-VII) has produced its own manifesto of issues affecting youth and policy proposals to address those issues. At the end of the year-long program, NDI connects the participants with political and civil society leaders to share their manifesto and receive feedback. At this stage, participants graduate the program and receive a certificate. Some groups of participants will continue to organize advocacy campaigns or projects beyond the end of the program, around the case studies they carried out throughout the year-long program. Most notably, three groups of alumni have either created or are in the process of creating official CSOs to address these issues and have received in-kind grants and physical office space and resources, as well as guidance from NDI. NDI also offers mini grants, not to exceed $500 to groups if they wish to continue research with a focus on a new aspect of the issue they have identified.

                 <p>
                    Sar El Wa2et premiered in the fall of 2018 as a mix of traditional political interviews conducted by Lebanese political talk show host Marcel Ghanem, and opportunities for Lebanese youth to ask questions and participate in policy debates. The show’s format and collaboration with NDI stemmed from attempts by Marcel and NDI to hold Lebanon’s first formal political debates prior to the May 2018 parliamentary elections. Although party leaders and candidates did not agree to debates at that time, Marcel asked for NDI’s assistance incorporating debates into a new program he was developing for MTV-Lebanon in order to create more opportunities for youth engagement and to mainstream the concept of debates in Lebanon in preparation for the next round of elections.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Sar El Wa2et’s studio audience is composed mostly of Lebanese youth who take turns participating in policy discussions with guests, which include ministers, members of parliament, and party leaders. At the end of each episode, two teams of three youth debate an issue raised during the program—the first live policy debates of their kind in Lebanon. Over the course of the initiative, NDI has trained hundreds of Lebanese youth to improve their skills for data-driven policy debates, and the Institute developed a scoring system so that the series of debates can serve as nationally-televised competitions.</p>

                 <p><strong>Policy Debate Trainings</strong></p>
                <p>
                    With the assistance of NDI staff from Jordan experienced conducting training for policy debates, NDI has helped MTV-Lebanon develop a roster of hundreds of young people from diverse political and sectarian backgrounds who are now qualified to ask questions from the audience and participate in televised debates. Not only does NDI teach the rules and formats of the debates, but the Institutealso helps young people develop necessary soft skills like active listening and public speaking, as well as helping them access research resources in order to formulate data-driven arguments. Guest issue experts provide participants with policy knowledge and credible sources, which the students then use to practice debating during training sessions.

                    <strong>Debate Policy Competition</strong></p>
                   <p>
                    NDI developed a scoring system based on a mix of technical debate skills and the quality of data-driven issue-based arguments. A guest issue expert from each episode sits alongside an NDI staff member to perform the evaluations not only of the teams, but of each individual participant. Over the course of a season, the scores determine who advances to future rounds, culminating in episodes dedicated to semi-finals and finals, effectively a nationally televised debate competition.

                 <p><strong>Cultural and Political Impact</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Marcel Ghanem and MTV-Lebanon hope that by expanding debate culture in Lebanon and by proving that young people can debate, they will pave the way for hosting Lebanon’s first debates between national political leaders before the next elections, currently scheduled for 2022. The show has achieved broad viewership and has resulted in viral moments on Lebanese social media. Some political leaders have remarked that they tune in specifically to watch the youth debate segment. This anecdotal evidence indicates that the debates are having at least some success shifting Lebanon’s political dialogue away from sectarianism and clientelism and toward data-driven problem solving.

                 <p><strong>Monitoring & Evaluation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Based on self-evaluations taken before and after NDI’s debate training, participants improved their capacity to build strong arguments from 3.3 to 4.6 out of 5. When rating their ability to use debate skills in practice, their confidence increased from 3.5 to 4.6 out of 5. Additionally, NDI staff have observed that the quality of the televised debates and the participant scores have improved over time.
